"# NodeJSDemo" 
This is simple demo of making Web APIs using NodeJS and MongoDB.
To run this demo first install NodeJS and MongoDB from below links: 

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

To ensure Node.js has been installed, run 
> node -v 
in your terminal - you should get something like v6.9.5
Update your version of npm with
> npm install npm --global
This requires Administrator privileges, and you may need to authenticate
Congratulations - you've now got Node.js installed, and are ready to start building!

Connecting to MongoDB using node.js
Now for the fun part: In order to connect to a MongoDB-server, you need a database driver, which defaults to node-mongodb-native. 
Fire up your command prompt again, switch to your node.js app folder and install it using below command: 

> npm install mongodb

once it's all Done you are ready to run this demo:
open command prompt and move to working directory then run following command:

> node server.js

We are live on 8000

You will get response like this !! That's all done.
